# There are many services interconnected with Cloud eye. All the services are logically united
# into groups named Namespaces. Every Namespace supports plenty of metrics, and each of them can
# be monitored. Besides particular metric you want to check up, you need to know Dimension -
# this entity pecifies the metric dimension of the selected resource type. In this
# example we want to monitor inbound bandwidth of public IP connected to our VPC. So first of
# all we will assign a new public IP for further monitoring.
